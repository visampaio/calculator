# calculator
Javascript project assignment for The Odin Project.

The objective is to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript and HTML.

I intend to use this project as a way to practice and review some Javascript fundamentals.

It's still a bit unfinished, as in it still has bugs and doesn't have a proper interface. I will work on that as soon as I have the time.
